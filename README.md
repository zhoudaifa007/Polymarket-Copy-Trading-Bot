## 1. Quick Start (For Beginners)

### 1.1 Step 1: Install Rust

**Windows:**
1. Download and run the installer from https://rustup.rs/
2. Follow the installation wizard
3. Restart your terminal/PowerShell

**macOS:**
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

**Linux:**
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### 1.2 Step 2: Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/terauss/Polymarket-Copy-Trading-Bot.git
git clone 
cd Polymarket-Copy-Trading-Bot
```

### 1.3 Step 3: Configure Your Settings

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   # Windows (PowerShell)
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   
   # macOS/Linux
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Open `.env` in any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.)

3. Fill in the required values (see [Configuration Guide](docs/03_CONFIGURATION.md) for details):
   - `PRIVATE_KEY` - Your wallet's private key (keep this SECRET!)
   - `FUNDER_ADDRESS` - Your wallet address (same wallet as private key)
   - `TARGET_WHALE_ADDRESS` - The whale address you want to copy (40-char hex, no 0x)
   - `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` - Get from https://www.alchemy.com/ (or use CHAINSTACK_API_KEY)

4. Optional: Adjust trading settings (see [Configuration Guide](docs/03_CONFIGURATION.md))

### 1.4 Step 4: Validate Your Configuration

Before running the bot, verify your setup is correct:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin validate_setup
```

This will check if all required settings are correct and provide helpful error messages if something is wrong.

### 1.5 Step 5: Test Mode (Recommended First)

Run in test mode to see what the bot would do without actually trading:

```bash
# Set MOCK_TRADING=true in your .env file, then:
cargo run --release
```

### 1.6 Step 6: Run the Bot

Once you're confident everything works:

```bash
# Enable trading in .env (ENABLE_TRADING=true, MOCK_TRADING=false)
cargo run --release
```

**Windows users:** You can also double-click `run.bat` after setting up your `.env` file.

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Required

1. **A Polymarket Account** - Sign up at https://polymarket.com
2. **A Web3 Wallet** - MetaMask recommended (with some USDC/USDC.e on Polygon)
3. **RPC Provider API Key** - Free tier from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/)
4. **The Whale Address** - The trader you want to copy (40-character hex address)

### 3.2 Recommended

- **Some Coding Knowledge** - Not required, but helpful for troubleshooting
- **Sufficient Funds** - The bot uses 2% of whale trade size by default (configurable)

## 4. Security Notes

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:**
- Never share your `PRIVATE_KEY` with anyone
- Never commit your `.env` file to git (it's already in `.gitignore`)
- Start with small amounts to test
- Use `MOCK_TRADING=true` first to verify everything works

## 5. How It Works

1. **Monitors** blockchain events for trades from your target whale (real-time via WebSocket)
2. **Analyzes** each trade (size, price, market conditions) using multi-layer risk checks
3. **Calculates** position size (2% default, with tier-based multipliers) and price (whale price + buffer)
4. **Executes** a scaled copy of the trade with optimized order types (FAK/GTD)
5. **Retries** failed orders with intelligent resubmission logic (up to 4-5 attempts)
6. **Protects** you with risk guards (circuit breakers) and safety features
7. **Logs** everything to CSV files for analysis

**Strategy Highlights:**
- **2% Position Scaling:** Reduces risk while maintaining meaningful positions
- **Tiered Execution:** Different strategies for large (4000+), medium (2000-3999), and small (<2000) trades
- **Multi-Layer Risk Management:** 4 layers of safety checks prevent dangerous trades
- **Intelligent Pricing:** Price buffers optimize fill rates (higher for large trades, none for small)
- **Sport-Specific Adjustments:** Additional buffers for tennis and soccer markets

See [Features Overview](docs/04_FEATURES.md) for feature details and [Strategy Guide](docs/05_STRATEGY.md) for complete trading logic.

## 7. Advanced Usage

### 7.1 Running Different Modes

```bash
# Standard mode (monitors confirmed blocks)
cargo run --release

# Mempool mode (faster, but less reliable)
cargo run --release --bin mempool_monitor

# Monitor your own fills only (no trading)
cargo run --release --bin trade_monitor

# Validate configuration
cargo run --release --bin validate_setup
```

### 7.2 Building for Production

```bash
# Optimized release build
cargo build --release

# The binary will be at: target/release/pm_bot.exe (Windows)
#                        target/release/pm_bot (macOS/Linux)
```

## 8. Output Files

- `matches_optimized.csv` - All detected and executed trades
- `.clob_creds.json` - Auto-generated API credentials (don't modify)
- `.clob_market_cache.json` - Market data cache (auto-updated)

## 9. Getting Help

1. Check [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/06_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
2. Run the config validator: `cargo run --release --bin validate_setup`
3. Review your `.env` file against `.env.example`
4. Check console output for error messages
5. Review [Strategy Guide](docs/05_STRATEGY.md) to understand bot logic
